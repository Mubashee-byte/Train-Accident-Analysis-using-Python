Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

CSV File Handling

# ðŸ“Œ Tasks Done:
Loaded and cleaned the dataset

Analyzed collisions per year, month, and location

Identified most common causes and weather impact

Filtered high-speed accidents and maintenance status

Visualized trends using line charts, pie charts, and bar plots

# ðŸ“Š Analysis:
The project helped identify critical accident zones, top collision causes, and highlighted the importance of weather and maintenance on casualties.
